There are a couple of leftover full size sets for sale<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://geekhack.org/showthread.php?27740-Ragnorock-s-Group-Buy-Leftovers!-Nyancat-Triforce-SC2-and-more-in-the-future!">HERE</a>The price is $85.</strong><br>Alright, here we go again. After much discussion, the “Blood” keyset integrated into Round 4 has been rescued by me and is happening now. This group buy is going to be quick, simple, and more efficient than any previous group buy I have run. Generally participants of previous group buys can skip most of this, as not much other than prices and shipping have changed. As these keys come in much higher quantities, bubble mailers are not an option. There should not be a problem for those ordering up to 2, even 3 sets in a flat rate box, but if you buy several expect your shipping rate to double for a second box.<br><strong>The Ragnarok keyset:</strong><br>87 Doubleshot keys + an extra Enter key using the custom legend “Execute” (88 keys in total)<br>[ Attachment Invalid Or Does Not Exist ] 40967[/ATTACH]<br><strong>Windows key will use the Windows 8 logo, form key will be standard. Expect a Biohazard symbol group buy for those looking for an OS agnostic version to happen immediately after orders close for this set.</strong><br>I’ve photoshopped the above image as much as I care to but you get the idea. Legends for the Windows and form keys are going to be standard, as most people around have their own custom modifier keys by now anyways. If anyone has any better ideas, shoot. Arrows etc are not final, Melissa didn’t even get this exact image, they are just using their standard DCS set. I will make sure we don’t have issues like “Back Space” though.<br>Its basically going to look a lot like this.<br>[ Attachment Invalid Or Does Not Exist ] 40968[/ATTACH]<br>The specific color code is RA on NN, exactly the same as the Terran keycap from the SC2 group buy (the inspiration behind this.)<br>In addition, I am offering several compatibility kits for use with various keyboards aside from the basic 87 key set. How this works is that you buy the 87 key set, and then choose which, if any, add on kits you want to suit your needs. That way the people just looking for the base set, which is what this group buy was originally limited to, don’t have to pay more for keys they don’t need. The kits start off expensive, but I told you from the start they would be. Any kits that get less than 15 takers will be dropped. Judging from the interest check, only ISO could have a problem with this. It would be really nice to get them to 25, as I’m sure you’ll agree.<br><strong>Tsangan’s Combatibility Kit</strong><br>Makes the 87 kit compatible with winkeyless keyboards such as Phantom, Dox, Cherry 1800, DKSaver, 356CL, Choc Mini, and many more! Ask Tsangan for clarification if you are unsure.<br>Contains 11 keys<br>[ Attachment Invalid Or Does Not Exist ] 41106[/ATTACH]<br>Ignore the color of course, but that gives a good idea of what you get.<br>2 Alt (1.5x)<br>2 Ctrl (1.5x)<br>These are just the bottom row in 1.5x size<br>2 “Star” 1x keys that fit row 4<br>2 Diamond/Meta/Super (1x keys)<br>This will go between the Alt and Control and is a 1x size key, with a Windows logo legend (Or we could do a diamond, more Phantom buyers need to speak up)<br>1 Stepped CapsLock<br>Same size as the capslock but it’s stepped. The stem is off center. I repeat, it is not center stemmed.<br>1 1800 Shift (1.75x)<br>This is a short shift in 1.75x size for the right shift so you can fit another 1x key beside it<br>1 Spacebar (7x)<br>Just longer then your average spacebar this one would be 7x size and it needs to be centre stem.<br><strong>The 104 Kit</strong><br>The 17 keys that make up the tenkey and its surrounding keys. Basically making this set compatible with full size ANSI keyboards.<br><strong>The ISO Kit</strong><br>3 Key set providing compatibility with various ISO keyboards. This set is not language specific, but a sortof hybrid US ISO layout meant to be non region specific. The problem with this kit is that it doesn’t have enough interest and is in jeopardy of being dropped, that and because of the J shaped return it is obnoxiously expensive. Unless the ISO people come out of the woodwork and get the counts to where the price is where everyone can agree on being willing to pay for, it will be dropped. The legend for the 3th key next to the small left shift is up for suggestion, as it has no universal legend. The legend for the other not obvious key is \ and |.<br>[ Attachment Invalid Or Does Not Exist ] 41438[/ATTACH]<br><strong>Rules and Notes</strong><br>Payment by Paypal only, do not order if you do not have a verified account yet, and get one if you want these.<br>Country must be specified with your order, US, CAN or whatever country you’re in.<br>My time is not free, I’m orchestrating this group buy because I want these keys myself, but I cannot be asked to spend the great deal of time that this requires without some compensation. I feel it’s pretty reasonable for me to ask for $1 out of the shipping cost as a handling fee. This has become standard for my group buys and the feedback I’ve gotten has been positive so if you have any complaints please enjoy the round 4 ordering process. Unlike the other group buys, there is not much ability for me to buy extras and make this worth my time, so for the sake of convenience and to make it a little more worthwhile, the prices for the kits have all been rounded up to the next dollar or so.<br>No trolls allowed. (Except for Ripster) &gt;.&gt;<br>I might be ordering extras, how many depends on our total orders and quantity discounts, but they are quite expensive to invest in. Whatever extra sets I do buy will be marked up to try and recoup some money for my time invested. If we hit somewhere past the “Magic Number” for the next discount, do not expect me to give that discount to everyone and buy the extras that make it cheaper, because if you do the math its over $1000 for me to do it. Simply stated, the magic number doesn’t exist, and doesn’t help anyone but me if I decide to order more and not share the discount. There has been plenty of vehement discussion on this, and I will not go through it all again here. Since there is not much of a way for me to earn any money at all off of this group buy, (the $1 is completely insignificant and really just pays for my gas… and we’re probably going to only be doing 50 orders or so.) I reserve the right to take advantage of quantity discounts if the numbers don’t happen, honestly it would be really nice of everyone to only get like 45 orders and let me pocket the $500 (plus whatever I’d get for selling the extra 5 sets,) but I don’t expect that to happen, nor will I cut off orders preemptively to try and screw people out of a discount. I think everyone here knows by now that this whole gig runs on mutual respect and amicability between everyone. I’ve built a pretty decent reputation here and I don’t intend to betray that.<br><strong>Instructions</strong></p><ol><li>Specify which keys you want in both a response to this thread and a PM. I am tallying orders from PMs, not from responses to this thread. The only difference between your reply and PM is that you include your Paypal email and your shipping address this timein the PM. I will be sending the Paypal invoice to this email. When you get that email, please pay immediately, there won’t be much time if you want to get these by March/April- it depends entirely on SP’s lead time.</li></ol><p>-The PM should also include which country you are in, US or Canada etc. Please put Ragnarok somewhere in the PM title and Question if it is a question. You can edit your order as many times as you want up until orders close and invoices start going out. Just be sure to send another pm and indicate somewhere in it that you want to change an order and it isn’t a new one.<br>2. Check for your name in the list of confirmed orders in the OP. Expect it to be updated generally within 48 hours, if you don’t see it, I haven’t gotten your order yet and you need to repost/resend your PM. If I didn’t add you to the list it may be because YOU DID IT WRONG. So double check you shiz and make sure it’s correct before resending. I will try my best to respond back to clear up any confusion but don’t count on it.<br>3. Wait for the orders to close, and when they do, expect an email from me asking for payment. I’m going to be calculating everyone’s individual cost via a really cool excel doc I’ve whipped up and it’s kinda what my major is so there shouldn’t be any errors. Nevertheless, if you do the math based upon the final count in the OP and calculate your cost to be different, then respond ASAP to clear it up. When you pay the invoice, your shipping address will probably be included, but I will be shipping to the address in your PM over what is in Paypal.<br>4. Wait for keycaps to show up. I will be providing updates in new posts as my work progresses so keep an eye on the thread.<br>5. <img src="https://keyboarddaily.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/geekhack/27473/huh.gif?x-oss-process=style/keyboarddaily" alt="???" title="Huh?"> <img src="https://keyboarddaily.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/geekhack/27473/huh.gif?x-oss-process=style/keyboarddaily" alt="???" title="Huh?">??<br>6.

I was surprised and disappointed with this, but unless everyone buying ISO agreed to pay those obscene rates, it wasn’t going to work. Thus it is now a 3 key set without the JRET.<br>Quantity discounts are not shared between keysets. For example, the Tsangan keysets ordered do not count toward the 104 sets ordered, the combined count does not matter.<br><strong>Shipping + Handling</strong> (Prices went up last time I went there)<br>US Options:<br>$6.50 ($5.50 + $1 handling… Flat rates went up in price.) A medium or large flat rate box that may be necessary if you order a large quantity of keys. <strong>Up to 3 base sets.</strong><br>Medium Flat Rate box: $12.50 <strong>More than</strong> <strong>3 base sets to probably any order in this group buy.</strong><br>Canada Options:<br>Canada didn’t go up in price so its still $15.<br>Medium Flat Rate box: $34<br>International:<br>$18 Small flat rate box<br>Medium Flat Rate box: $49<br>All of these will ship in the Priority flat rate boxes, which is what these rates are based off of. Seriously the flat rate international small box rate is now $17. I lost money on the orders that paid $15 last time. I am not happy about this either but unless I can find an affordable substitute for boxes before I start collecting money these are the prices. Boxes are much more expensive to buy, so I’m going to take a look at various options but don’t expect them to magically go down 10 dollars in price. Multiple boxes and potentially insurance may be required for large orders. I will work with those buyers to ensure fair shipping.<br><strong>Extra large orders will be custom quoted via PM.</strong><br>Paypal fees:<br>3% + $0.30 and is calculated in the invoicing.
