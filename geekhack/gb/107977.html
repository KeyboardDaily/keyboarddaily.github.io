Geekhackers,<br>Were Mechlovin, a team of two Mech enthusiasts based in Vietnam and specialised in providing PCB &amp; Plate solutions. Since our first Group buy back in last October, we have successfully run many others, while working with reputable members of the community in collaboration projects.<br><strong>THE STORY</strong><br>Some months ago, we were contacted on Discord by some community members about helping make a replacement PCB for the Kyuu 65% board. Being huge fans of the Kyuu (but sadly have never been able to own one), we initiated the project and made 5 prototypes that were later sent over to volunteer testers in Singapore and the US. Some key findings:</p><ul><li>The USB-C connector fits perfectly. This was our most pressing concern due to the fact that most Kyuu cases have very small USB cutout, and we simply measured the positioning of the port by feel (with the help of some pictures sent by testers).<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://keyboarddaily.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/geekhack/107977/JC6LgqA.jpg?x-oss-process=style/keyboarddaily"><img src="https://keyboarddaily.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/geekhack/107977/JC6LgqA.jpg?x-oss-process=style/keyboarddaily"></a></li><li>We got the Left Shift and Enter stabs orientation wrong. We got too caught up with the USB port positioning and didnt pay attention to the fact that stabs orientations on those particular 2 mods are reversed on the Kyuu (north-facing LShift and south-facing Enter) compared with most other 65% PCBs. This requires a very simple fix which has been reflected in the latest design:<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://keyboarddaily.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/geekhack/107977/T5Lm6OY.png?x-oss-process=style/keyboarddaily"><img src="https://keyboarddaily.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/geekhack/107977/T5Lm6OY.png?x-oss-process=style/keyboarddaily"></a></li></ul><p>**AVAILABILITY AND COMPATIBILITY<br>**<br>Due to the fact that its a 65% PCB with centered USB-C connector, the 9 MIGHT fit certain cases that utilise a similar design, such as the Exclusive E6.5. However, due to the mentioned peculiar stabs orientations which may lead to incompatibility with other 65% switchplates, we DO NOT recommend using the 9 for any other boards apart from the Kyuu.<br>This is a Group buy for only the PCB. Plates will not be offered due to the lack of access to files or the actual plate. There is NO MOQ. Considering how limited the Kyuu is and there may not be much demand for the PCB going forward, this is very likely to be a one-time thing, so wed appreciate it if you can get as many as you need, and help spread the words to other Kyuu owners.<br>**GENERAL GB INFORMATION<br>**<br>**CLICK HERE TO JOIN THE GROUP BUY<br>**: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://forms.gle/5KYGBNsKBBT2poTU6">https://forms.gle/5KYGBNsKBBT2poTU6</a><br>PROTOTYPE PHOTO ALBUM: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgur.com/a/0A8cPNk">https://imgur.com/a/0A8cPNk</a><br>JOIN OUR DISCORD SERVER FOR LATEST UPDATES: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://discord.gg/fSsbECG">https://discord.gg/fSsbECG</a><br> Price: $48 (USD) per unit; plus international shipping from Vietnam (calculated based on buyers location)<br> MOQ: None<br> Group buy form opens on Saturday, August 8th at 23:00 (GMT+7) for TEN DAYS.<br> Invoices will be sent out ASAP after form submission.

You can also choose DHL Express, which is very fast and reliable for an added cost.<br>*We would like to thank all the volunteer testers of the prototype who provided us with invaluable information and feedback!<br>*<br>THANK YOU AND HAVE A GOOD ONE!<br><strong>ROUND 2</strong><br><strong>BACKGROUND</strong><br>Some time last year, we attempted to design a Kyuu compatible PCB called Mechlovin 9 (please pardon the obviousness) out of requests from community members who had trouble finding one. Having had no access to a real Kyuu unit, we made a number of prototypes and sent them to volunteer testers around the world. Thanks to their help, we were able to move to GB phase, and the rest was a very smooth experience.<br>It was always meant to be a one-time thing considering how limited the board was, but the fact that Quantrik has generously open-sourced the case file has sort of sparked a DIY frenzy, along with it came new requests for the Mechlovin 9 PCB to be rerun, and were happy to oblige.<br>It is very important to be noted that the first round of the Mechlovin 9 PCB had been ICed, run, and completed BEFORE the original files were released. Both rounds of our compatible PCBs (including this one) are completely independent projects, and hence, do not violate the terms of use for Quantriks licenced design.<br>**AVAILABILITY AND COMPATIBILITY<br>**<br>Due to the fact that its a 65% PCB with centered USB-C connector, the 9 MIGHT fit certain cases that utilise a similar design. However, due to the non-standard stabs orientations which may lead to incompatibility with other 65% switchplates, we DO NOT recommend using the 9 for any other boards apart from the Kyuu.<br>This is a Group buy for only the PCB. We have received multiple requests regarding offering the plates, but that also means using the shared plate file which goes against its terms of use.<br>**GENERAL GB INFORMATION<br>**<br>CLICK HERE TO JOIN THE GROUP BUY: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://forms.gle/ky1nArVzUWboDMB76">https://forms.gle/ky1nArVzUWboDMB76</a><br>PROTOTYPE PHOTO ALBUM: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgur.com/a/0A8cPNk">https://imgur.com/a/0A8cPNk</a><br>JOIN OUR DISCORD SERVER FOR LATEST UPDATES: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://discord.com/invite/jqVbMpM">https://discord.com/invite/jqVbMpM</a><br> Price: $45 (USD) per unit; plus international shipping from Vietnam (calculated based on buyers location)<br> MOQ: None<br> Group buy form opens on Wednesday, March 31st at 23:00 (GMT+7) for TEN DAYS.<br> Invoices will be sent out ASAP after form submission.

Hardware reset available.<br> PCB color: Black solder mask with immersion gold<br>We have made a conscious decision of switching from the ARM-based STM32F303 MCU on the first rounds PCB to the more basic Atmega32A MCU. Using the STM32 on this pretty straightforward PCB design is an overkill and will increase the final pricing significantly for no good reasons, especially now that this MCU has been in supply shortage for months now. With the use of the 32A, all features that matter, including QMK and VIA compatibility, stay; while the price can be lowered compared to the previous round.<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://keyboarddaily.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/geekhack/107977/FhQoOMn.jpg?x-oss-process=style/keyboarddaily"><img src="https://keyboarddaily.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/geekhack/107977/FhQoOMn.jpg?x-oss-process=style/keyboarddaily"></a><br>Prototype image - final product has matte black solder mask<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://keyboarddaily.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/geekhack/107977/nv9YaLf.jpg?x-oss-process=style/keyboarddaily"><img src="https://keyboarddaily.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/geekhack/107977/nv9YaLf.jpg?x-oss-process=style/keyboarddaily"></a><br>**LEAD TIME AND SHIPPING<br>**<br>The expected production time is 6-8 weeks after the GB period finishes, so were looking to start shipping at the end of May/ early June 2021.<br>Shipping during the pandemic is generally still unpredictable. The (very) good news is we have been able to work with our EU and US proxy to further reduce the base shipping rate, so it’s now $19 instead of $25 like with previous GBs (please note that this is the base rate and ordering in higher quantities may result in higher shipping fees).<br>DHL(3-5 day delivery) has announced a new and increased fee scheme (they normally increase their shipping rates by around 5% each year), but were honouring the rates offered in last year GBs, at least for now. Though were still offering standard shipping (using national post) for non-US and non-EU destinations, we highly recommend choosing the DHL option for much faster and safer shipping. The current DHL base rate applies for all packages under 2 kilos, so it may be a good idea to combine order with local friends.<br>While we do send important GB updates via emails, the best way to stay updated and connected is to join our Discord server, and maybe follow us on Instagram if you’re interested in our work.</p></div><footer class="entry-meta entry-footer"><span class="ico-folder"></span> <a class="article-category-link" href="/categories/GB/">GB</a>, <a class="article-category-link" href="/categories/GB/%E9%94%AE%E7%9B%98/">键盘</a>, <a class="article-category-link" href="/categories/GB/%E9%94%AE%E7%9B%98/65-66-67-68/">65/66/67/68</a> <span class="ico-tags"></span><ul class="article-tag-list" itemprop="keywords"><li class="article-tag-list-item"><a class="article-tag-list-link" href="/tags/flying1911/" rel="tag">flying1911</a></li></ul><div id="comment"><div id="lv-container" data-id="city" data-uid="MTAyMC8yOTQ4MS82MDQ5"><script type="text/javascript">!function(e,t){var n,c=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0];"function"!=typeof LivereTower&&((n=e.createElement(t)).src="https://cdn-city.livere.com/js/embed.dist.js",n.async=!0,c.parentNode.insertBefore(n,c))}(document,"script")</script><noscript>为正常使用来必力评论功能请激活JavaScript</noscript></div></div></footer><hr class="entry-footer-hr"></div><nav id="article-nav"><a href="/geekhack/ic/107978.html" id="article-nav-newer" class="article-nav-link-wrap"><strong class="article-nav-caption">上一篇</strong><div class="article-nav-title">【IC】POM Half Plates for the Jane V1 and V2 (and other compatible keyboards)</div></a><a href="/geekhack/ic/107963.html" id="article-nav-older" class="article-nav-link-wrap"><strong class="article-nav-caption">下一篇</strong><div class="article-nav-title">【IC】GMK Fundamentals | GB Thread is up!</div></a></nav></article><aside id="sidebar"><div id="toc" class="toc-article"><strong class="toc-title">文章目录</strong><ol class="nav">无</ol></div></aside></section></div></div><footer id="footer" class="site-footer"><div class="clearfix container"><div class="site-info">&copy; 2022 KeyboardDaily All Rights Reserved. <span id="busuanzi_container_site_uv">本站访客数<span id="busuanzi_value_site_uv"></span>人次 本站总访问量<span id="busuanzi_value_site_pv"></span>次</span></div><div class="site-credit">Theme by <a href="https://github.com/iTimeTraveler/hexo-theme-hipaper" target="_blank">hipaper</a></div></div></footer><script>var wrapdiv=document.getElementById("wrap"),contentdiv=document.getElementById("content");wrapdiv.style.minHeight=document.body.offsetHeight-document.getElementById("allheader").offsetHeight-document.getElementById("footer").offsetHeight+"px",contentdiv.style.minHeight=document.body.offsetHeight-document.getElementById("allheader").offsetHeight-document.getElementById("footer").offsetHeight+"px"</script><div style="display:none"><script src="https://s11.cnzz.com/z_stat.php?id=1260716016&web_id=1260716016" language="JavaScript"></script></div><script type="text/x-mathjax-config">MathJax.Hub.Config({
