It is not required that you submit this form. If you do not submit this form, the original address that you submitted for the group buy will be used (not Paypal’s address).<br>Greatfirewall has informed me that packing is just about done and shipping from China will arrive a week after it’s shipped.<br>Thanks, GL1TCH3D<br>MARCH 8TH, 2016, PLEASE READ<br>Update!<br>Got news that the cases are now completed and just waiting on the PCBs before shipping everything out.<br>livingspeedbump has also agreed to receive the order from china to distribute the USA orders (the bulk of the orders) so depending on the shipping from china and PCBs, it might be possible to have the USA orders delivered before the end of April.<br>However this will most likely not result in shipping discounts, but I’ll have to tally that up in the end to see if there’s money from the shipping fund to send back.<br>If anybody has an issue with this please bring it up before the order is shipped.<br>Thanks, GL1TCH3D<br>March 3rd, 2016<br>The order was placed successfully with the factory producing the parts in February.<br>This pushes back the estimated delivery. So far we’re looking at a completion of production around mid-late March. If I estimate shippng of around 2 weeks that means that the parts would arrive to me early-mid April. However my exam period starts mid-April which will slow down distribution / sorting.<br>Shipping to North America tends to be within the week once shipped.<br>Another note: there were some fees that were not negotiated on beforehand. GFW agreed to eat them this time since the invoices were already paid (and it would just be problematic to try and hunt down an extra $3-4 a person) but if there is a round 2, the price will increase marginally.<br>Thanks, GL1TCH3D<br>Previous update:<br>More</p><p>Invoices have been sent!<br>If you have questions or comments let me know.<br>If you are not in Canada or USA there are cheaper untracked options than what are on the invoice, message me about those and any other notes that you would like to add (such as customs declarations).<br><strong>Additional Acrylic sets available at $25 + fees each and will be invoiced separately.

This is the site that will be building the main firmware for the board.<br>Step two: Choose the Kimera as the keyboard (not the two headed)<br>Step three: Click the config button and replace the text in the “matrix mapping” box with the following code <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://pastebin.com/Bf2uQWHv">http://pastebin.com/Bf2uQWHv</a><br>Step four point one: Go to keyboard layout editor and setup your mapping <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/83b7eb12b3bccdf4c55d">http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com//#/gists/83b7eb12b3bccdf4c55d</a><br>Step four point two: When you’re making your layouts, make each layout separately AND INCLUDE BOTH LEGENDS. For example, the “.” key requires the “.” and “&gt;” in the mapping to work. See the help section on enjoyclick for all the symbols to use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.enjoyclick.org/tkg/#help">http://www.enjoyclick.org/tkg//#help</a><br>Step five: Paste the layouts for each layer into the corresponding boxes on enjoyclick<br>Step six: Choose your fn options. NOTE: fn covers a wide range of options including LEDs, not just changing layers.<br>Step seven: See the following for details on the LEDs <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://pastebin.com/zSVN4f9j">http://pastebin.com/zSVN4f9j</a><br>Step eight: Download your firmware as a .eep file<br>Step nine: From the following toolkit, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/kairyu/tkg-toolkit">https://github.com/kairyu/tkg-toolkit</a>, download the files in the windows tree.<br>Step ten point one: Run the batch file “setup.bat” from the toolkit. This only has to be done the first time you’re flashing your board.<br>Step ten point two: The options tree is as such “12Kimera core&gt;N&gt;1.Default&gt;1.ateml_dfu”<br>Step eleven: Click the reset button on the golbat PCB (it’s on the back).<br>Step twelve: Run “zadig_2.1.2.exe” and Install the Driver (Not WCID). This only has to be done the first time you’re flashing the golbat.<br>Step thirteen: Drag and drop the .eep firmware file that you created onto the batch file “reflash.bat”<br>Step fourteen: <img src="https://keyboarddaily.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/geekhack/78510/huh.gif?x-oss-process=style/keyboarddaily" alt="???" title="Huh?"><br>Step fifteen: Profit<br>That’s all folks!

BY ORDERING YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS and details.<br>This is the submission form to PURCHASE the Golbat 40% kit in the group buy.<br>Invoices will be sent out on January 21st, 2016 and payment must be received by January 22nd, 2016 to hold the spot.<br>A waiting list will be formed to fill the spots that are unpaid.<br>The order is FIRST COME FIRST SERVE. Meaning that the first submissions will be the highest on the list and the first to ship once the order arrives.<br>There are 50 orders for round one. One kit per person / household / username.<br>If you are taking the soldering service you must send me the LEDs / switches /stabilizers yourself. I will send my postal box information with the invoices should you choose this option. I will refuse any packages that have a customs charge attached. Mark your parcels as a gift for $20 to ensure there is no problem with customs.<br>If you’re asking me to do the soldering service there is NO GUARANTEE of delivery time. I can only do them as my work and school schedule allow.<br>The PCB comes presoldered with the diodes and resistors so the only thing you need to make the board work is switches, stabilizers and a USB cable. However there are no switches, stabilizers, cables or LEDs included in this group buy.<br>The kit includes: 1 top plate (2 if you purchase the normal + HHKB option), 2 mid acrylic layers (one goes above the PCB and one goes under the PCB), 1 bottom plate and 1 PCB with resistors and diodes soldered on.<br>I am only the distributor in this deal. I will place the order for the kits and ship / distribute the kits. The wait time between ordering the kits from China and receiving them here in Canada is between 4-6 weeks. For that reason you must agree to waive your right to disputing the payment through PayPal since it is not possible for me to ship within the PayPal time frame.<br>Defective units will be handled in a way I deem most appropriate.<br>This could be offering partial refund or a different, spare part at your choice or, depending on the severity of the defect, request replacement parts from the manufacturer in the second round of orders.<br>The keyboards are custom order so once the order is placed / payment is received there will be no refunds if you decide to change your mind or anything of that sort.<br><strong>The standard Golbat 40% set will cost $80USD + fees and shipping.</strong><br>For an extra $15 the HHKB plate will be included (so you’ll get both the standard plate and the HHKB style plate). This is $95USD + fees and shipping.<br>Shipping it being done from Quebec, Canada and should be $12-17USD anywhere in Canada with insurance for $200 CDN.<br>To ship to the USA the price is $15-20USD including insurance for $100CDN. (It’s a big jump for the extra insurance).<br>If you require shipping elsewhere, expect at least $40-60 to Europe and $80 elsewhere for tracking and insurance. If you wish a quote before ordering, send me a message before placing the order to avoid cancellations.<br>Otherwise the default option will be “cheapest shipped with tracking”<br>The PayPal fees will be added to the invoice total and will be 3.9%.<br>Options:<br>Colors:<br>Aluminum：sliver, black, pink, blue, green,purple, gold <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://imgsrc.baidu.com/forum/pic/item/9ec0381f95cad1c8298f95cd7a3e6709c83d51b6.jpg">http://imgsrc.baidu.com/forum/pic/item/9ec0381f95cad1c8298f95cd7a3e6709c83d51b6.jpg</a><br>Acrylic：you can choose the colors in this link： <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.1-c.w137644-66242819.2.ZNnbyp&id=19615052779">http://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.1-c.w137644-66242819.2.ZNnbyp&amp;id=19615052779</a><br>For the acrylic, please list both the item code from the images AND a cropped image of the specific color that you wanted so I can double check to avoid mistakes.<br>Please visit <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=78080.0">https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=78080.0</a> for all the newest information and instructions on flashing.<br>YOU CANNOT CHANGE YOUR ANSWER ONCE SUBMITTED.

YOUR PLACE ON THE LIST IS THE TIME OF SUBMISSION OF THE REVISED FORM.<br>If it’s just a typo like missing a letter in your email address that’s fine but if you forget to completely answer a required question (somehow) well… that’s a different story.<br>Right now the only thing I’m waiting on is for a bit of time to go through the steps of creating and flashing the firmware so that I can help with that when the time comes.<br>I will consider offering a flashing / soldering service for $35 if there’s enough interest to bother getting my own soldering iron (instead of constantly going to someone’s place to use one).<br>Otherwise it’s just a kit sold as is.<br>All the standard questions will be asked in the GB: Username, address, email, choice.<br>If you have any more questions or concerns please raise them now before I open the form in the coming days.<br>The board requires CHERRY PCB MOUNT stabilizers.
