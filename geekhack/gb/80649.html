I’m still here, still working to get orders out. Biggest issues at the moment are coordinating with my family members to get some things sorted and organized Stateside, the national Chinese holiday this week grinding everything to a halt, and lack of time.<br>Currently, there are several international orders that have yet to be shipped, as well as the US orders from the extras sale which are awaiting PCBs.<br>The color remake batch for R2 is running into delays as well. The designer told me the factory was inundated with work, and yet is currently on vacation (it’s like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Day_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China">Independence Day for China</a>, but for this whole week).<br>A couple more international orders were sent out.

The shipments are mostly 2-day but the 2-day shipments are supposed to arrive on Thursday despite being shipped out on Monday. Odd.<br>See you guys on the other side (of the world). I’ll update when I land to tell you guys I’m okay. Then int’l orders will be shipped out.<br>The second batch (for the mistaken color remakes) is still in production and I will update on that as I get news.<br>8/21/2016<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://i.sli.mg/PZcKo5.jpg"><img src="https://i.sli.mg/PZcKo5.jpg"></a><br>Shipping out tomorrow.

Thanks for your patience folks.<br>7/24/2016<br>I took a couple days off because of all the issues that keep popping up regarding my buys and it was getting a bit overwhelming, apologies for the late reply and update. Bad news. All the international orders were packed in time by my dad after several all-nighters coordinating with him via video chat (all because the PCBs didn’t arrive in time before my flight from China), but they were unable to be shipped out.<br>Reason:<br>More</p><p>The reason for that was the passing of my grandmother who had terminal cancer at the age of 80, and her illness was the reason that my dad went to China in the first place. This date coincided with the packing of the boards and my dad’s flight out of China on the 22nd, and I wasn’t going to force him to pack and ship some orders, however important they are, and take time away from my grandma’s final moments. It’s a /<em>/</em>/<em>/<em>ty situation all around.<br>So the international orders can’t be sent out until I return to China a month from now. I know I’ve kept you guys waiting and I’m sorry for that, but please bear with me a bit longer.<br>Acrylic diffuser plates are getting remade for the US orders because the screw holes connecting those to the case are misaligned. That’s already done and en route to the designer who will be shipping the other orders to me.<br>7/15/2016<br>International orders are being worked on right this moment in China, and I’m coordinating it from the U.S. DHL tracking numbers will be available in approximately one week for int’l, and I will contact the buyers accordingly.<br>Screw mount stabs are being delayed, and orders w/ screw mount stabs are also delayed as a result. The team’s been working on the screw mount stabs and the molds for those, and they’re repeatedly fine-tuning the design. I should have more news on those next week.<br>Appreciate your patience, everyone.<br>7/14/2016<br>I’m in the US woooooooo<br>PCBs arrived in China. Need some time, but they’ll get sorted and the int’l orders shipped. U.S. orders are being prepped for shipment from China but pending a thorough recount of both int’l and U.S. orders to make sure there won’t be any mis-sent items.<br>7/12/2016<br>Finished sorting the responses for the color mistake. The second order will be sent to the factory very soon.<br>Prepping the remaining orders for shipment right now. Leaving for the plane in 5 hours.<br>PCBs were delayed because the guy who was supposed to send them to be was slow to act despite my reminding him daily for an entire week (/</em>/</em>/<em>/</em>).

I’ve received most of the cases for international orders and am putting them together. The PCBs should reach my hands tomorrow or the day after, and int’l orders will be shipped by then. The sole int’l purple case order is delayed a bit as the designer sent me the engraved version meant for someone else, so the designer will be sending out the purple order once I send him the PCB, plate, and stabilizers associated with that order.<br>U.S. orders will be fulfilled by me once I’m back in the U.S., starting on the 13th.<br>7/7/2016 pt.2<br>Got some stuff in the mail~ <img src="https://keyboarddaily.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/geekhack/80649/grin.gif?x-oss-process=style/keyboarddaily" alt=";D" title="Grin"> What could they be…?<br>7/7/2016<br>International orders for PCBs and cases are both on their way to me. US orders are being prepped for shipment by the others. My flight was pushed back to the 12th which gives a bit of extra breathing room for sorting the int’l orders myself.<br>7/2/2016<br>Manufacturing is complete. The cases are en route to the designer from the factory, who will be sorting through them briefly before sending them to me, since he has the rubber feet and screws for the cases (and the bonus). PCBs are all finished as well and the ones for international orders are en route to me (also including the bonus). There’s a chance that they won’t make it in time before I get on my flight to the U.S. on the 10th. If that happens, I have at least two other capable individuals in China who can take care of the international orders, so no problems there.<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://i.sli.mg/sd1ze0.jpg"><img src="https://i.sli.mg/sd1ze0.jpg"></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://i.sli.mg/Y1xZZ3.jpg"><img src="https://i.sli.mg/Y1xZZ3.jpg"></a><br>6/15/2016<br>Just checking in.

Cases cost 100 RMB more than the price I had down from the last buy (because of the “new materials/factory”, which is supposed to be higher quality). I paid it off using the entire contingency fund and more, and am now projected to be in the red for this buy. Probably going to have to invoice all buyers for the difference once again.<br>/<em>/</em>/<em>/</em>, I really didn’t want to have something like this happen after saying that there weren’t gonna be extra fees in the beginning.<br>5/21/2016<br>No real news but it’s been 6 days so I thought I’d chime in. Finalizing the transfer and the money is almost all here. Received the notification last night that I should be receiving it in another day or two.<br>This is going slower than I expected.<br>5/15/2016<br>Still in the midst of transferring funds. Also ran into a wall w/ Chase after the rep told me I couldn’t make the transfer. Attempting a different method. Will know the results of that in a week.<br>Fronted the money for PCB fabrication, and added an extra hundred dollars for changing the PCB color to black (good news for those of you who said they didn’t like the red).<br>Next update will be when production for the cases is underway.<br>5/11/2016<br>Chase locked my account until I called them w/ my debit card in hand when I tried to do a wire transfer. That was fun. Especially the part where I had to call when it was working hours in the US, but then had an Indian call center handle my call during the night here in China.<br>Still working on getting the money halfway across the world without being cockblocked by every institution that handles money ever. Stay tuned.<br>5/5/2016 (assume all future updates are Beijing time)<br>All orders processed and confirmed as paid. The payment period of the GB is officially over.
