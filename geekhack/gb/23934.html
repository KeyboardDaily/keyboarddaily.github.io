this time around I’m going to try and optimize things a bit by putting everything I’m running in one thread. I’m also going to try to spare everyone the extreme longcat post that my last order threads started with to make it easier to find any details. (Edit: seems like I failed again lmao) However if you’re looking for more clarification on anything then please do go back and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://geekhack.org/showthread.php?22445-Starcraft-2-Doubleshots-Round-2.22-You-can-(haz)-nao.-(ORDER-THREAD)&p=422954&viewfull=1#post422954">check this thread</a> for reference… most of it is the same.<br><strong>I should mention now, that while I have a strong case for why the “Triforce” cannot be copyrighted and we should be able to have it made, Signature Plastics retains sole discretion on which keycaps they will produce. If I start to collect orders and they say they will not make it, then all orders for it will be dropped. I will not be collecting money until that has been sorted out.</strong> (As of now they will be producing it)<br>What is being offered:<br>NyanCat PBT Dyesublimated keys<br>[video=youtube;QH2-TGUlwu4]<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=QH2-TGUlwu4%5B/video%5D">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=QH2-TGUlwu4[/video]</a><br>[ Attachment Invalid Or Does Not Exist ] 31902[/ATTACH]<br>[ Attachment Invalid Or Does Not Exist ] 31903[/ATTACH]<br>[ Attachment Invalid Or Does Not Exist ] 31904[/ATTACH]<br>[ Attachment Invalid Or Does Not Exist ] 31905[/ATTACH]<br>(With blue stars above the rainbow)<br>[ Attachment Invalid Or Does Not Exist ] 31906[/ATTACH]<br>Test keys, the top row of white keycaps are the only ones that are on the correct keycap color. The rainbow will be more wavy and the stars will be blue as in the other pictures.<br>These keys will be standard backspace size and row 1/4 (Depending on which row numbering scheme you follow… they fit both the Function row and `1234567890-= keys)<br>The idea is to have Nyancat as the backspace, with a trail of rainbow all the way across the number row behind her (I’m just going to go ahead and assume Nyancat is a girl because its more moe.)<br>You can of course, forego this option and just get the backspace. <strong>However if you do want to do the full row, the number of 1x keys you want are 7 “Up” and 6 “Down” keys.</strong> Other than that, the buyer is free to order however many keys they want of each kind to make the rainbow as long as they desire. Overall the difference of the rainbow is slight, but the variance in the stars helps provide the illusion that each key is different, and not that you have an entire row of identical keys… when really they just alternate. is important to note that the backspace key ends on a “Down” so it should be followed first by an “Up” key for maximum Nyan.<br>Doubleshot “Triforce” key, available in both Esc Row 1/4 and Mod size.<br>[ Attachment Invalid Or Does Not Exist ] 38202[/ATTACH]<br>Colors are YG on VV, gold on green ofc.<br>Design:<br>[ Attachment Invalid Or Does Not Exist ] 31907[/ATTACH]<br>Colors:<br>[ Attachment Invalid Or Does Not Exist ] 31908[/ATTACH]<br><strong>Rules and Notes</strong><br><strong>Payment by Paypal only</strong>, do not order if you do not have a verified account yet, and get one if you want these.<br>Country must be specified with your order, US, CAN or whatever country you’re in.<br>My time is not free, I’m orchestrating this group buy because I want these keys myself, but I cannot be asked to spend the great deal of time that this requires without some compensation. I feel it’s pretty reasonable for me to ask for $1 out of the shipping cost as a handling fee. That isn’t any great deal of profit but I think that’s pretty fair since anyone else could have stepped up and run this show and nobody did. This has already been discussed and the feedback I’ve gotten has been positive so if you have any complaints please enjoy the round 4 ordering process. :flypig:<br>No trolls allowed. (Except for Ripster) &gt;.&gt;<br>I will be ordering extras, how many depends on our total orders and quantity discounts, but there will be extras, and I plan on getting a lot of them. However to encourage and reward everyone for buying them in the group buy itself, <strong>expect them to be marked up if you are buying leftovers.</strong><br><strong>Instructions</strong></p><ol><li>Specify which keys you want in both a response to this thread <strong>and a PM</strong>. <strong>I am tallying orders from PMs, not from responses to this thread.</strong> The only difference between your reply and PM is that <strong>you include your Paypal email <strong>and your shipping address this time</strong></strong>[/SIZE][/U][/B]in the PM.[/B] I will be sending the Paypal invoice to this email. When you get that email, please pay immediately, there won’t be much time if you want to get these by December.</li></ol><p>-The PM should also include which country you are in, US or Canada etc. Please put Nyan or Triforce somewhere in the PM title. <strong>You can edit your order as many times as you want up until orders close and invoices start going out. Just be sure to send another pm and indicate somewhere in it that you want to change an order and it isn’t a new one.</strong><br>2. Check for your name in the list of confirmed orders in the OP. Expect it to be updated generally within 48 hours, if you don’t see it, I haven’t gotten your order yet and you need to repost/resend your PM. If I didn’t add you to the list it may be because YOU DID IT WRONG. So double check you shiz and make sure it’s correct before resending. I will try my best to respond back to clear up any confusion but don’t count on it.<br>3. Wait for the orders to close, and when they do, expect an email from me asking for payment. I’m going to be calculating everyone’s individual cost via a really cool excel doc I’ve whipped up and it’s kinda what my major is so there shouldn’t be any errors. Nevertheless, if you do the math based upon the final count in the OP and calculate your cost to be different, then respond ASAP to clear it up. When you pay the invoice, your shipping address will probably be included, but I will be shipping to the address in your PM over what is in Paypal.<br>4. Wait for keycaps to show up. I will be providing updates in new posts as my work progresses so keep an eye on the thread.<br>5. <img src="https://keyboarddaily.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/geekhack/23934/huh.gif?x-oss-process=style/keyboarddaily" alt="???" title="Huh?"> <img src="https://keyboarddaily.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/geekhack/23934/huh.gif?x-oss-process=style/keyboarddaily" alt="???" title="Huh?">??<br>6.

Since this is calculated from the exact final count of keys, I won’t know the final price per key until orders close… but obviously if we order tons of keys its going to be really insignificant.

For example, the “Up” rainbow key counts separately than the “down” key even though they’re the same size and pricing structure.<br>Another note on quantity discounts that caused some drama in the past. Many other group buys have been run, including my previous ones where the order count reaches a point where the overall cost of ordering at the next quantity discount is actually cheaper than ordering the lesser current quantity. From everything I know, just about everyone I know of has ordered up to that next discount, and used the savings to fund the purchase of extras. This time around, for the sake of full disclosure, I’m mentioning it up front. It depends on how the counts end up, but I will most likely be sharing the discount with everyone when I do my “extras” order up to calculations. That means that if the count hits 130 and I decide to order 150, I may charge everyone the 150 price when it comes time to collect money… or I may not. It all depends on how much its going to cost me to do that… if its a ton, then I think its reasonable for everyone participating to chip in for the purchase of the extras. The reason being is that if I can’t buy any significant amount of extras, I can’t sell enough to make it worth the effort, and I won’t be running any more group buys. Most of you already know all of this and are still more than happy to be a part of this group buy and all the others. If that poses any sort of problem with you, feel free to send me a PM and we can hopefully work something out. I really like this community and I want everyone to benefit, I’m not trying to profiteer off of everyone. ¬.¬<br>[/B]</li></ul><p><strong>Shipping + Handling</strong><br>US Options:<br>$4.50 ($3.50 + $1 handling) Bubble Mailer <strong>(Preferred)</strong><br>$6.20 ($5.20 + $1 handling… Flat rates went up in price) For a flat rate box that may be necessary if you order a large quantity of keys.<br>Canada Options:<br>$6 US dollars.
