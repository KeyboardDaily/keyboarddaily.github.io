We were planning on closing the sales, and placing the order. However, we have received quite a considerable amount of messages from members of the community, concerning extensions on the GB period. We want to provide anyone who wants a Lumina with the time to order one, so we have decided to fulfill your requests!<br>We are extending the GB by another week! The new final date for the Lumina GB is now September 3rd, 2018.<br>Additionally, Cosmos Prima is now available on the store to be purchased by anyone! Cosmos Prima example<br>It will be available in the Build Your Own section of the store, when you choose the corian color for your top and bottom corian pieces.<br>The Acrylic Base option is on the store in the Build your Own kit section, and we have also put up a premade kit as an example of one of the many variations you can come up with in the Build-Your-Own section of the website.<br>_<br>The Acrylic base is an option that not only reduces weight, for those of you who do not want a 7 pound board to lug around, but it also reduces the prices. The addition of the acrylic base brings the price range low to $231 with an acrylic plate chosen. Come over and check out all the different color combinations you can come up with, and see how it affects the pricing!<br>While we are extending the GB another week, we will also be taking the time to keep working on getting the best international pricing for shipping. Bear with us as we work on getting those numbers, and once we do we will post them in the next GB update!<br>Make sure to get your orders in by then, and let us know if you have any questions!<br>Here are some images of Gmk Stormtrooper on a Cameo White Lumina<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://keyboarddaily.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/geekhack/97020/202580.png?x-oss-process=style/keyboarddaily"><img src="https://keyboarddaily.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/geekhack/97020/202580.png?x-oss-process=style/keyboarddaily" alt="202580-0" title="[GB] Lumina GB : Update posted in Comments"></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=97020.0;attach=202582;image"><img src="https://geekhack.org/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=97020.0;attach=202582;image" alt="202582-1" title="[GB] Lumina GB : Update posted in Comments"></a><br>UPDATE SEPTEMBER 2nd:<br>Hello all!<br>Just a reminder, tomorrow, September 3rd, at 11:59pm EST, we will officially close the GB, and start production of the Lumina orders.<br>Additionally we have prices for shipping for EU as well as AU.<br>Because of the variance in weight for the different bases, there are many variables.

I was told that I would have finished production units by now, but I suspect that the base manufacturing has not been started yet. For the month or so, I have been scoping out a new manufacturer for the bases, and I have samples coming for both brass and aluminum to make sure that quality is good for this one I have found. I will be eating the cost for the time being from the Lumina base order I placed with my current manufacturer in order to get stuff done faster, as like you all have been waiting, I have too with this particular manufacturer. If it comes to it, I will also find a new manufacturer for the Corian, as big of a loss as it would be.<br>I’m still actively trying to get any good news from the current manufacturer, but regardless of what I hear back, there will be a new manufacturer for the bases in order to speed up the production. The new place plans to have samples in my hands within the next couple of weeks, so I am hoping that is true, and not all talk like the current manufacturer.<br>I do apologize for the delay. Frustration levels are high, and the GB is long, but I intend to finish it out no matter what it takes.<br>If you have any questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to reach out to me on discord @tesletron/#0001 or on here(although I still suck at geekhack) or by email.<br>Additionally, the site has been taken down, and no other orders are being taken. I will update both here and on discord.<br>Update 4/15/19<br>Hey all! An update on the overall Lumina situation: We have gotten satisfactory samples of both the Aluminum AND Brass bases (upgraded from Polished Brass to PVD coated) and the pvd brass plates. Aluminum plates are in and ready for the anodization process. Both meet our standards and knowing quality is up to spec, mass production order is being placed. Linked below are pictures of the plates and bases. Acrylic Plates and Bases have been QC’d and are finished. The waldo is now also officially in the QMK configurator.<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgur.com/a/LY05uP5">https://imgur.com/a/LY05uP5</a><br>Thanks for Reading!<br>Update 5/6/19<br>Samples from new factory came in today, and quality is absolutely above and beyond what I was expecting. I have tentatively assembled the board to check fit with the other parts, and everything is very comfortable and easy to assemble. Corner Radii fit perfect, threaded inserts are as solid as can be, and production will now move forward at full throttle. Will update with lead time this week. Thank you all again for your patience and support on this project!<br>Here is an album of the Cosmos Prima variant with the Brass plate and weight features: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgur.com/a/BRiDQGv">https://imgur.com/a/BRiDQGv</a><br>Update 5/8/19<br>New samples in with more colors, update to follow with lead time, in the meantime, here is an album of the Elderberry, Cosmos Prima, and Red in various lighting environments. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgur.com/a/pXzHdi0">https://imgur.com/a/pXzHdi0</a></p></div><footer class="entry-meta entry-footer"><span class="ico-folder"></span> <a class="article-category-link" href="/categories/GB/">GB</a>, <a class="article-category-link" href="/categories/GB/%E5%85%B6%E4%BB%96/">其他</a><div id="comment"><div id="lv-container" data-id="city" data-uid="MTAyMC8yOTQ4MS82MDQ5"><script type="text/javascript">!function(e,t){var n,c=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0];"function"!=typeof LivereTower&&((n=e.createElement(t)).src="https://cdn-city.livere.com/js/embed.dist.js",n.async=!0,c.parentNode.insertBefore(n,c))}(document,"script")</script><noscript>为正常使用来必力评论功能请激活JavaScript</noscript></div></div></footer><hr class="entry-footer-hr"></div><nav id="article-nav"><a href="/geekhack/ic/97027.html" id="article-nav-newer" class="article-nav-link-wrap"><strong class="article-nav-caption">上一篇</strong><div class="article-nav-title">【IC】Pheilcia&#39;s new product</div></a><a href="/geekhack/ic/97014.html" id="article-nav-older" class="article-nav-link-wrap"><strong class="article-nav-caption">下一篇</strong><div class="article-nav-title">【IC】60％ Optical Switch PCB</div></a></nav></article><aside id="sidebar"><div id="toc" class="toc-article"><strong class="toc-title">文章目录</strong><ol class="nav">无</ol></div></aside></section></div></div><footer id="footer" class="site-footer"><div class="clearfix container"><div class="site-info">&copy; 2022 KeyboardDaily All Rights Reserved. <span id="icp_info"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://beian.miit.gov.cn/">沪ICP备2021016355号</a></span><br><span id="busuanzi_container_site_uv">本站访客数<span id="busuanzi_value_site_uv"></span>人次 本站总访问量<span id="busuanzi_value_site_pv"></span>次</span></div><div class="site-credit">Theme by <a href="https://github.com/iTimeTraveler/hexo-theme-hipaper" target="_blank">hipaper</a></div></div></footer><script>var wrapdiv=document.getElementById("wrap"),contentdiv=document.getElementById("content");wrapdiv.style.minHeight=document.body.offsetHeight-document.getElementById("allheader").offsetHeight-document.getElementById("footer").offsetHeight+"px",contentdiv.style.minHeight=document.body.offsetHeight-document.getElementById("allheader").offsetHeight-document.getElementById("footer").offsetHeight+"px"</script><div style="display:none"><script src="https://s11.cnzz.com/z_stat.php?id=1260716016&web_id=1260716016" language="JavaScript"></script></div><script type="text/x-mathjax-config">MathJax.Hub.Config({
