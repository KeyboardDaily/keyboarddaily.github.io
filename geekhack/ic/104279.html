process, I learned that people used foam, shelf liner, or other dampening materials inside of their keyboards to help improve the sound of their keyboard. I found that the material Sorbothane was hailed by some as the ultimate solution to helping reduce pinging and bought a few sheets. I quickly ran into the problem of cutting the material. I did hours of brainstorming and research and ended up 3D printing a stencil and using an X-Acto knife to try to make the necessary precise and accurate cuts. It got the job done and fit but didnt produce perfectly accurate or precise cuts. In this process, I found out about waterjet cutting and submitted requests for quotes for numerous waterjet cutting services and received quotes that ranged from $200-$658.34 to cut Sorbothane sheets for a single keyboard. Mind you, these were all quotes in which I was supplying the Sorbothane sheets myself so the quotes were purely for the cost of cutting the sheets. Needless to say, this was way out of my budget which is why I opted to cut the sheets myself.<br><em>Photos showing the process I went through to cut my own Sorbothane sheets:</em> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgur.com/a/cQYS8f1">https://imgur.com/a/cQYS8f1</a><br>I learned about Wazer, a company that makes a desktop waterjet cutting device that was able to cut various rubbers and metals. However, this machine new is listed at $9,999 and while it is much cheaper than other industrial waterjet cutting machines, it is still quite expensive. I received an email today expressing that they are launching a new program for refurbished devices for $6,499. I am unable to independently afford this but I was hoping that I would be able to launch a pre-order for custom cut Sorbothane sheets and plates to help me afford this machine.<br><strong>Okay, So What?</strong><br>If youre like me and were seeking a solution to help reduce the pinging/sound of your keyboard and wanted pre-cut sheets of Sorbothane to line your keyboard with, I am interested in purchasing a machine that would allow me to provide this service. Please fill out this form to help me gauge interest and decide whether or not to continue to pursue this idea.<br>Additionally, if you are interested in custom cut plates of virtually any material, waterjet cutting is able to cut a myriad of materials that are unable to be laser cut.<br>If there is enough interest, my next step is to test/validate my idea. I am by no means the first one to attempt waterjet cut Sorbothane sheets. I was told that Manofinterests has attempted something similar and encountered issues. Sorbothane is quite a gummy material that can be difficult to cut cleanly. However, I have a few ideas I want to implement to attempt to circumvent/resolve these issues. Among them are to 1. Freeze the Sorbothane sheets, and 2. Squash them between two thin plywood sheets to prevent any flexing/deformation of the sheet while being cut. I am not personally aware of these techniques being attempted but if you happen to know more about this or have tried this before, I am all ears and happy to hear about your experience.<br>The company selling the waterjet machine offers a service where they allow you to submit your own material and design to test cut. My first step would be to submit files to see if these techniques are effective at cutting Sorbothane cleanly and to a degree where I feel confident selling pre cut sheets of it. I have been able to cut by hand Sorbothane sheets for my own keyboards and while they fit and work, the cuts are not clean enough for me to offer to others. Upon testing and validating these techniques to effectively cut Sorbothane sheets, I would then launch a pre-order/group-buy for people to purchase either pre cut sheets of Sorbothane or custom plates. I currently have the CAD files for my two personal builds, KBDFans 60% Tofu and Drop CTRL Low Profile and would need to CAD additional files for other keyboards. I currently utilize 2-3 sheets of Sorbothane, 1-2 sheets below the PCB (not terribly complex), and 1 sheet between the PCB and Plate (quite complex to account for the switch and stabilizer holes). While the best process would be to hand measure with caliper all the dimensions, CAD, and 3D-print or 2D print shapes to test fit, I should also be able to have people submit scanned images of their plate and interior of their keyboard and create CAD files from those (provided the interior design of the keyboard is not terribly complex). I would be able to cut custom plates with customer provided CAD files or scanned images of plates in their desired layout. Alternatively, I would also be happy to borrow someone elses keyboard to make the measurements by hand with a caliper and test and ensure the sheets fit perfectly.<br><strong>Timeline for this Project</strong><br>In the scenario enough people are interested, I anticipate the test cutting period to take about a month (End of February), the purchase and setup of the machine to take another month (March), and the CADing and actual cutting of peoples Sorbothane sheets to vary depending on the popularity of the design (April and Later). KBDFans Tofu 60% and Drop CTRL board sheets would ship first as I have the CAD files for those boards already. Any alternate designs would take additional time to CAD and cut which could very easily take an additional month to a few months.<br><strong>What Kind of Pricing Should I Expect?</strong><br>In short, Im still figuring this out. Depending on the level of interest, I may be able to order materials in bulk and receive a discount. However, custom Sorbothane sheets will certainly cost more than MKUltras foams so if you are budget conscious or want to support a great guy, Id recommend you visit his site and support him <img src="https://keyboarddaily.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/geekhack/104279/smiley.gif?x-oss-process=style/keyboarddaily" alt=":)" title="Smiley"><br><strong>Background</strong><br>A little background on me, Im 22 years old living in the Bay Area. I just graduated from UCSD (UC San Diego) with a double individual major in Entrepreneurship &amp; Innovation and Product Design. I stumbled upon the custom mechanical keyboard community while building a desktop PC for my father. He said he liked my current mechanical keyboard (a Logitech G610 with Cherry Red switches) and in the quest to find a replacement keyboard, I thought to myself, why not build a custom keyboard. I naively thought I could save a few pennies only to later discover how expensive this hobby is. However, I fell in love with this community and immediately began devouring keyboard content and working on my own builds (so far I own a KBDFans 60% Tofu w/ YOK Holy Pandas, Drop CTRL w/ Vintage Blacks, and a Topre Realforce R2 w/ BKE Light Domes).<br><strong>How Can I Trust You?</strong><br>While everyone I have met in this hobby and community has been incredibly kind and amazing, I am well aware of those who run unfulfilled group-buys and essentially scam people of their hard-earned money. Theres not much I can say and I feel that it will be my actions that will build and earn your trust. Trust shouldn’t be given but rather earned. What I can say is that for me personally, there is no greater feeling in the world than building and delivering a product to a satisfied customer. This feeling does not exist if the customer is not excited and satisfied with their purchase. Just the thought of delivering a /<em>/</em>/*/*ty product and having someone regret their purchase is a fear I have and something I will work hard to avoid.</p></div><footer class="entry-meta entry-footer"><span class="ico-folder"></span> <a class="article-category-link" href="/categories/IC/">IC</a>, <a class="article-category-link" href="/categories/IC/%E5%85%B6%E4%BB%96/">其他</a><div id="comment"><div id="lv-container" data-id="city" data-uid="MTAyMC8yOTQ4MS82MDQ5"><script type="text/javascript">!function(e,t){var n,c=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0];"function"!=typeof LivereTower&&((n=e.createElement(t)).src="https://cdn-city.livere.com/js/embed.dist.js",n.async=!0,c.parentNode.insertBefore(n,c))}(document,"script")</script><noscript>为正常使用来必力评论功能请激活JavaScript</noscript></div></div></footer><hr class="entry-footer-hr"></div><nav id="article-nav"><a href="/geekhack/ic/104292.html" id="article-nav-newer" class="article-nav-link-wrap"><strong class="article-nav-caption">上一篇</strong><div class="article-nav-title">【IC】Lockheed 33 Macropad</div></a><a href="/geekhack/ic/104278.html" id="article-nav-older" class="article-nav-link-wrap"><strong class="article-nav-caption">下一篇</strong><div class="article-nav-title">【IC】GMK Rainy Day | Update： GB Date Oct 6th.
