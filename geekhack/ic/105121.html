I am honored to be invited by the author to introduce two coming kits by JER here. The first one is the J80S and the other one is JERGO, an ergo kit coming in April.<br>If you have any suggestions or questions, please leave a comment here or contact the author directly at <strong><a href="mailto:&#x33;&#x30;&#x33;&#x36;&#x36;&#57;&#x31;&#53;&#56;&#x40;&#113;&#113;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#109;">&#x33;&#x30;&#x33;&#x36;&#x36;&#57;&#x31;&#53;&#56;&#x40;&#113;&#113;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#109;</a>.</strong><br><strong>Here is the translated letter from JER:</strong><br>Hi! Friends of GH, nice to meet you again! This time we are introducing the new JER80S. The GB will come in the near future. The original plan was to start a small inventory in-stock GB, but the factory was influenced by the coronavirus. The current pictures and detailed information are not complete yet because the e-gray I want is still waiting for the sample. But I will keep updating the pictures in the future under this thread.<br>The original version of JER80(formerly JER-A06) has already finished 2 GB here, and there are many posts of detailed pictures on both Reddit and Zfrontier. J80 was my first kit, and it is also a kit that I always want to bring to perfection.<br>In the last production of the J80R2 international version, I and the new foundry DT.heart [LAB] cooperated very happily, with super-fast delivery speed and high-quality control. The feedback was also very good. But the earlier J80R1, which was produced by EVE, still had unshipped and defects kits unfinished for more than two years (the keyboards of at least 7 customers had not been serviced or shipped till now since EVE refused to do so. EVE took away the keyboards of 7 from my customers and no longer responded).<br>So there are 3 main purposes of making JER80S this time, the first one is to improve the kit, and the second one is to give my customers some compensation.<br>I will give JER80S for free to those JER customers whose keyboards were away by EVE. The third one is to thank those friends who have always supported and helped me.<br>In J80R2 international edition GB last time, I and my founder dt.heat (lab) invested about 5,000 USD to set up a NEW e-milky white color(slightly yellow-white). This good-looking color gives a Retro-style feeling, And it has received a very high evaluation for both the color and surface treatment process. There will only about 20 JER80S available for public GB at this time, but with a new color for it: e-gray.<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://keyboarddaily.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/geekhack/105121/237722.png?x-oss-process=style/keyboarddaily"><img src="https://keyboarddaily.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/geekhack/105121/237722.png?x-oss-process=style/keyboarddaily" alt="237722-1" title="[IC] JER80S(JER-A06), Ultimate 80% OG Cherry Style Keyboard Kit, GB JULY 1ST"></a><br>The following picture is the surface of e-milky white taken in the factory:<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://keyboarddaily.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/geekhack/105121/237724.png?x-oss-process=style/keyboarddaily"><img src="https://keyboarddaily.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/geekhack/105121/237724.png?x-oss-process=style/keyboarddaily" alt="237724-2" title="[IC] JER80S(JER-A06), Ultimate 80% OG Cherry Style Keyboard Kit, GB JULY 1ST"></a><br><strong>JER80S Features:</strong><br>It has exactly the same structure as the previous JER80R2 featuring a Plateless Design. The PCB is directly suspended from the top cover to show the flexibility of the PCB and improve the typing feedback. All the features of JER80R2 will be retained. I just add some new features that were not available before.<br>You can think of it as an upgraded version:<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://keyboarddaily.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/geekhack/105121/237726.png?x-oss-process=style/keyboarddaily"><img src="https://keyboarddaily.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/geekhack/105121/237726.png?x-oss-process=style/keyboarddaily" alt="237726-3" title="[IC] JER80S(JER-A06), Ultimate 80% OG Cherry Style Keyboard Kit, GB JULY 1ST"></a><br><strong>Key Features:</strong><br><strong>1: “NCR” nameplate:</strong><br>The front nameplate is designed to be convenient for matching various color schemes. The kit contains no less than three NCR replacement nameplates.<br><strong>2: LEMO style aviation plug:</strong><br>Change the integrated cable to the aviation plug. This time the aviation plug will be made and soldered by me. Customers do not need to solder wires or plugs. OG styling with USB-C or Mini is not what I want, but the previous integrated USB line is more or less inconvenient.<br><strong>3: More light indicator block stickers.</strong><br><strong>4: Titanium alloy screws:</strong><br>It s an S version,So every detail has designed to Perfection.<br><strong>5: Large Stainless Steel Weight on the back:</strong><br>Polished by hand to get the effect closest to the mirror. This cost is a bit high. I have thought about using PVD, but it is not as Hi-end as hand polish. Since I want to make a high-end kit, just make it explosive. BOOM!<br><strong>6: Bronze nameplate on the back:</strong><br>It is used to mark the unique serial number and production date. Of course, you can fill in your name here, because I have reserved a grid for your name.<br><strong>7: New e-color:</strong><br>About 20 units sold in public will have an e-NCR color theme, the top cover will use the newly designed e-gray, and the bottom cover is the e-milky white. All non-sale and gifted versions will use the opposite color them as a distinction (including 7 users mentioned above, friends those who helped me, and staffs)<br><strong>8: Special surprise:</strong><br>Well, this one is very interesting.<br>At the time of delivery, I will send out <strong>ONE unique J80S within 20 of them</strong>. This unique JER80S bottom cover will be made of pc. (PC with a large of Stainless Steel Weight. It sounds exciting, isnt it!)<br>It’s not that simple. The fortunate user who received this special JER80S can contact me via email and I will send you a brand new JER product: JER1800 or JERGO. And the JER80S bottom cover made of aluminum alloy will be sent to you together, with shipping cost on my own.<br><strong>Current progress:</strong><br>All CNC parts have finished, Stainless Steel Weight is waiting to be hand polished, and surface treatment is waiting for color matching and e-coating.<br>Group start time: It should be in March, and I will be updated here after a clear date has been decided. My original plan of starting an in-stock GB is influenced by the coronavirus, so I have to start the GB first, and since most of the process has been done already, the shipment will not take a long time.</p></div><footer class="entry-meta entry-footer"><span class="ico-folder"></span> <a class="article-category-link" href="/categories/IC/">IC</a>, <a class="article-category-link" href="/categories/IC/%E9%94%AE%E7%9B%98/">键盘</a>, <a class="article-category-link" href="/categories/IC/%E9%94%AE%E7%9B%98/80-84-87/">80/84/87</a><div id="comment"><div id="lv-container" data-id="city" data-uid="MTAyMC8yOTQ4MS82MDQ5"><script type="text/javascript">!function(e,t){var n,c=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0];"function"!=typeof LivereTower&&((n=e.createElement(t)).src="https://cdn-city.livere.com/js/embed.dist.js",n.async=!0,c.parentNode.insertBefore(n,c))}(document,"script")</script><noscript>为正常使用来必力评论功能请激活JavaScript</noscript></div></div></footer><hr class="entry-footer-hr"></div><nav id="article-nav"><a href="/geekhack/gb/105127.html" id="article-nav-newer" class="article-nav-link-wrap"><strong class="article-nav-caption">上一篇</strong><div class="article-nav-title">GMK RGBYK Add-on Kit (GMK RGB 2020) - SHIPPING STARTED!</div></a><a href="/geekhack/ic/105120.html" id="article-nav-older" class="article-nav-link-wrap"><strong class="article-nav-caption">下一篇</strong><div class="article-nav-title">【IC】J Ergo?
