I’ll be writing up the GB text, watch for it as soon as I figure out whatever has to happen to be posted in the GB section.<br><strong>Update 2017.02.12</strong>: So, I talked to Digikey. No further price breaks, even at 25k pieces. I’ll be doing some further poking around tonight, but I think the assumption at this point is that this is final pricing.<br>If you know of another source we should look in to, please let me know ASAP. Otherwise, we’ll become a group buy and go with this.<br><strong>Update 2017.02.12</strong>: Numbers from Digikey are in. They didn’t offer any further per-piece discount on on order of 20,000: $.21220 and $.09408 on 8134-HC-8P2 and 9-1437514-0, respectively, is what they’re offering. I will call them on Monday to see if there’s a price break around there somewhere, and also to push forward the questions about packaging, which they ignored. Either way, once that’s done I’ll convert this to a GB and we will be off.<br><img src="https://keyboarddaily.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/geekhack/87127/160202.png?x-oss-process=style/keyboarddaily"><br><strong>Update 2017.02.09</strong>: There is no update.

Im curious to find out if we can make it worthwhile to order a big pile of Holtite sockets.<br>First up, if you have no idea what Im talking about, but want to, please read the next section. If you have no idea what Im talking about and want to keep it that way, Im unclear on why youre still reading. Otherwise, you can skip the next section.<br>What the…?<br><img src="https://keyboarddaily.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/geekhack/87127/158141.png?x-oss-process=style/keyboarddaily"><br>You stick them in the holes of your PCB, and then can seat switches without soldering. This makes the switches removable, so you can change them without desoldering. A different model exists that is the correct size for LEDs.<br><img src="https://keyboarddaily.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/geekhack/87127/158142.png?x-oss-process=style/keyboarddaily"><br>I see some people misspelling them as hotlites, too. There is a video over at /r/mk on seating them:<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/5a399o/guide_how_to_make_your_pcb_hotswappable/">https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/5a399o/guide_how_to_make_your_pcb_hotswappable/</a><br>Also, some folks over there have created a spreadsheet to keep track of PCBs for which these work and for which they dont:<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K1qt70E2mcuaHBXYrpPHXlpl7FNaXLo0u_TOe67cVdY/pubhtml?gid=986897710&single=true">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K1qt70E2mcuaHBXYrpPHXlpl7FNaXLo0u_TOe67cVdY/pubhtml?gid=986897710&amp;single=true</a><br>Application spec for sockets: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.te.com/commerce/DocumentDelivery/DDEController?Action=srchrtrv&DocNm=114-13033&DocType=SS&DocLang=EN">http://www.te.com/commerce/DocumentDelivery/DDEController?Action=srchrtrv&amp;DocNm=114-13033&amp;DocType=SS&amp;DocLang=EN</a><br>Ways in which these don’t work<br>Generally, it seems they work better on Korean-designed PCBs. The important part is that they are not guaranteed to work on just any old board. Your milage is likely to vary.<br>Another point is that, especially on the bottom row, alternate layout accomodations frequently end up resulting in cramped PCBs, with some through-holes being odd shapes or really tiny. You cant use these there, and will have to solder those, depending on your exact layout/PCB combo. Also, also, sometimes through-holes overlap, so there isn’t enough surrounding material in which to seat these. Sometimes that can be overcome by soldering them.<br>In my very limited experience, sometimes pulling a switch will also pull the socket. Ive experienced no PCB damage from this, but I have lost a couple that went flying. This could be that I didnt seat them well enough, but I suspect it is just the nature of the beast - through-hole sizes vary.<br>There is an associated tool sold for seating these. It costs over $300, and I have not used it or even seen it in person. The soldering-iron method described in the video above works for me.<br>The takeaway here is that they aren’t magic, designed for this particular application, or suitable for every PCB.<br>Motivation<br>My first experiment with Holtites to facilitate hotswappable switches went fairly well, and I imagine Im going to be using quite a bit more over the next year. In fact, I ordered more last week. The price points are annoying; theyre spendy in quantities suitable for a single board, and the volume price breaks make a serious difference, but at quantities that are absurd for anyone who isnt mass-producing boards for a living.<br>That naturally suggests a group buy. Below are details on what Ive worked out, and some questions for those who would be interested in going in on this. But before that, a word about me.<br>This would be my first group buy. Im relatively new in these parts, but I like to think have been a decent citizen in our conversations, and Ive been a fairly active participant in others buys. On the plus side, I am a very good imitation of a responsible adult, have run a company in the past and worked for myself for over a decade, so I’m pretty confident in my ability to handle the logistics, accounting, communications and whatnot. While Im new here, Ive been actively online since the early 90s under my real name, and have many, many reasons not to poison that. If something with the group buy somehow went massively pear-shaped, I am sufficiently financially stable to spend my way out of any mistakes I make, and will make sure that everyone who takes part ends up whole. All of that said, I wouldnt fault anyone here for not extending trust.<br>My goals are to stockpile a fair pile for myself at a decent price, and will not mark anything up. Depending on demand, Im considering investing in an additional little pile of these and selling those at a markup at my own store, but that may or may not happen. Either way, I intend to keep this entirely transparent, with the costs public and early-and-often communication as it proceeds, if it proceeds.<br>Now that that’s out of the way<br>People are calling two different pin sockets Holtites (after the series name): receptacles for switches, and for LEDs.<br>For the switch sockets, there are two choices: gold or tin/lead. Gold is of course more expensive, and for our purposes, entirely cosmetic.<br>For the LED sockets, Digikey requires a large (50K) minimum order, and their pricing is significantly worse than Mouser. Unfortunately, Mouser is backordered, estimating nine weeks lead-time. But for a group buy, that perhaps works out OK. I have some on backorder there, mainly to see if that 9-week figure is real - sometimes it isn’t. Ive only found them in lead - as far as I know, there is no gold option made.<br>Pricing:<br>Starting at 2500 pieces, the lead switch sockets cost $0.1559 each, the gold, $0.2122. I have not yet asked for quotes on larger orders, pending getting an idea from you all about what sort of volume were actually talking about.<br>Lead ( <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/8134-HC-8P3/A114359-ND/1151726">http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/8134-HC-8P3/A114359-ND/1151726</a>):<br><img src="https://keyboarddaily.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/geekhack/87127/158143.png?x-oss-process=style/keyboarddaily"><br>Gold ( <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/te-connectivity-amp-connectors/8134-HC-8P2/A114358-ND/2188091">http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/te-connectivity-amp-connectors/8134-HC-8P2/A114358-ND/2188091</a>):<br><img src="https://keyboarddaily.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/geekhack/87127/158148.png?x-oss-process=style/keyboarddaily"><br>For the LED sockets, Mouser sells them for $.084 each in lots of 5000. at 50K, the cost is $.079/ea.<br>The second-worst thing I can imagine happening here is getting a some huge number of these in one big bag, and subsequently spending the next three years of my life counting them out. Im going to ask Digikey and Mouser about possible options there, but the recent order I made of 1000 came in 10 100-count bags, so if that holds for larger orders (and if custom-count bagging is too expensive) I think these will be purchased and delivered in 100-count increments.<br><img src="https://keyboarddaily.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/geekhack/87127/158144.png?x-oss-process=style/keyboarddaily"><br>As a bit of anecdata, my first order of these was for 250, and I ran out socketing a TKL with a numpad. I think I lost four and ruined another two installing them.<br>So, questions:</p><ul><li>Interested?</li><li>Unless we end up looking at insane volume, it would be best to pick either tin/lead or gold, so we can maximize the volume discount. Im thinking gold, because it seems to me that people like that sort of thing, but Im frequently wrong. What are your preferences?</li><li>I have the impression that the LED sockets will be less popular. SIP sockets are a reasonable substitute in many situations, and anyway, lots of people dont care about LEDs. OTOH, if youre already committed to this insanity, my thought is if the board might ever end up in the hands of someone who likes the blinkenlights, they arent comparatively a huge additional expense; may as well socket it all up. So the question is, assuming youre in for a packet of switch sockets, would you also go for the LED sockets?</li><li>Mr. T vs. Mothra: who wins?<br><img src="https://keyboarddaily.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/geekhack/87127/158146.png?x-oss-process=style/keyboarddaily"></li></ul></div><footer class="entry-meta entry-footer"><span class="ico-folder"></span> <a class="article-category-link" href="/categories/IC/">IC</a>, <a class="article-category-link" href="/categories/IC/%E5%85%B6%E4%BB%96/">其他</a><div id="comment"><div id="lv-container" data-id="city" data-uid="MTAyMC8yOTQ4MS82MDQ5"><script type="text/javascript">!function(e,t){var n,c=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0];"function"!=typeof LivereTower&&((n=e.createElement(t)).src="https://cdn-city.livere.com/js/embed.dist.js",n.async=!0,c.parentNode.insertBefore(n,c))}(document,"script")</script><noscript>为正常使用来必力评论功能请激活JavaScript</noscript></div></div></footer><hr class="entry-footer-hr"></div><nav id="article-nav"><a href="/geekhack/gb/87149.html" id="article-nav-newer" class="article-nav-link-wrap"><strong class="article-nav-caption">上一篇</strong><div class="article-nav-title">【GB】RAMA ALUMINIUM X|O CAP (SHIPPED)</div></a><a href="/geekhack/ic/87117.html" id="article-nav-older" class="article-nav-link-wrap"><strong class="article-nav-caption">下一篇</strong><div class="article-nav-title">【IC】DSA Cyrillic Keyset</div></a></nav></article><aside id="sidebar"><div id="toc" class="toc-article"><strong class="toc-title">文章目录</strong><ol class="nav">无</ol></div></aside></section></div></div><footer id="footer" class="site-footer"><div class="clearfix container"><div class="site-info">&copy; 2022 KeyboardDaily All Rights Reserved. <span id="icp_info"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://beian.miit.gov.cn/">沪ICP备2021016355号</a></span><br><span id="busuanzi_container_site_uv">本站访客数<span id="busuanzi_value_site_uv"></span>人次 本站总访问量<span id="busuanzi_value_site_pv"></span>次</span></div><div class="site-credit">Theme by <a href="https://github.com/iTimeTraveler/hexo-theme-hipaper" target="_blank">hipaper</a></div></div></footer><script>var wrapdiv=document.getElementById("wrap"),contentdiv=document.getElementById("content");wrapdiv.style.minHeight=document.body.offsetHeight-document.getElementById("allheader").offsetHeight-document.getElementById("footer").offsetHeight+"px",contentdiv.style.minHeight=document.body.offsetHeight-document.getElementById("allheader").offsetHeight-document.getElementById("footer").offsetHeight+"px"</script><div style="display:none"><script src="https://s11.cnzz.com/z_stat.php?id=1260716016&web_id=1260716016" language="JavaScript"></script></div><script type="text/x-mathjax-config">MathJax.Hub.Config({
